    Where is Indian Country?<hr>
It’s everywhere we stand.<br>
It’s anywhere we dance.<br>
It’s where the earth loves<br>
the feel of our feet.<br>

 Welcome to Indian&nbsp; Country.
<pre>
    What does that mean?
       It means this is where
            we lift our <code>voice</code> in song
                and make a joyful drumbeat
                    so our hearts can sing along.
</pre>
Welcome to Indian Country.
